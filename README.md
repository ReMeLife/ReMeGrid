## Ecosystem Components

### ReMeLife Tokens
- **CAPs (Care Action Points)**: Earned through app usage, forum activity, referrals, and data sharing. Stored as MySQL datapoints.
- **REME Tokens**:
  - **REME**: Earned via CAPs, redeemable for discounts in ReMe Market.
  - **LUMI Tokens**: Earned through use of LUKI AI tools; convertible to REME2.

## AI + Blockchain Integration

### Convex Lattice Grid
- **CRDT-based consensus**: Ensures real-time, conflict-free data replication.
- **Convex Release Curve**: Manages token supply growth based on demand.
- **Bonding Curve**: Dynamic pricing model for REME token purchases.
- **Tokengine**: Enables minting, burning, and bridging of tokens across chains.

---

##  ReMeLife Foundation
The **ReMeLife Foundation** is a member-owned, AI-powered decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) built on Convex. It governs token supply, ecosystem growth, and premium distribution.

- **Governance**: Managed by a board of governors and community voting.
- **Treasury**: Receives gas fees and market commissions to fund development.
- **Transparency**: All transactions and decisions are recorded on-chain.

##  RUBI: ReMeLife Universal Basic Income
**RUBI** is a quarterly passive income distributed to members based on revenue generated within the ReMeLife ecosystem.

- Funded by commissions, data monetization, and token cycling.
- Distributed via smart contracts governed by the ReMeLife Foundation.
- Designed to support carers, charities, and under-supported communities.

##  ReMe Market & Use Cases

- **Discount Redemption**: Members use REME tokens to reduce fiat costs.
- **Charity Nodes**: Charities earn yield and commissions by staking.
- **Corporate Rewards**: Businesses incentivize health and engagement.
- **NFT Marketplace**: Schools and care homes raise funds via long-tail NFTs.

---

##  Developer Notes

- **Smart Contracts**: Vesting, conversion, and DAO logic deployed on Convex.
- **Wallet Integration**: CAD020 tokens visible in ReMeLife wallet; bridged to MetaMask via ERC20 wrapping.
- **Low Gas Fees**: Internal transactions incur minimal costs, benefiting users and treasury.
